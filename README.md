# NYC Flights 2013 Analysis and Delay Prediction 
This report aims to outline the factors, both passenger controllable (e.g. the airline used) and uncontrollable (e.g. weather), that most influenced whether or not a flight would arrive late, along with the extent of this delay. The goal here was to allow potential passengers to make “smarter” booking decisions in order to minimise the possibility of experiencing delays, while also allowing them to better expect potential delays. 
To do this the report first outlines the details of the underlying data used. Following this, details of delays by airline will be discussed. This will include basic details of which airline experiences the most delays, but will also detail how severe these delays can be and their variation by airline. Next, a discussion of any other factors in the dataset that contribute to delays will be conducted. Finally, the results of the two models built to predict delays and the accuracy of their predictions will be presented.
